# hello-world

Hello! 

I am a student at the University of Central Florida studying Radio-Televison with a minor in Marketing. I have always wanted to learn how to code and started venturing into coding a year and a half ago! I worked in retail and childcare, but felt as if I wanted more. So I joined a coding bootcamp and began my journey with learning how to code. I felt as if learning how to code was something exciting and rewarding and it constantly challenged me. Now I want to continously learn more and enhance my coding to better my skills and grow within the job market. 

Facts About Me:
- I love to travel (I really want to visit South Korea).
- I have a tendency to soak up new information, because I really like learning.
- I enjoy having new creative experiences.
- I was born in Honduras
- In the future I want to learn these languages: Korean, Spanish, Manderian, Japanese, and French to name a few.
